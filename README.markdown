### What is linxphp?
linxphp is an open source, object oriented MVC web framework built using PHP5 that aims to be swift, simple, and small.

linxphp is licensed under a [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), so you can legally use it for any kind of open source, commercial, or personal project.

### Why another PHP Framework?
We think most known PHP Framework out there have grown a lot, and turned overcomplicated in the process. Other Frameworks claim to be user friendly to non-developers by using a complex content management system, making good developers to hate them.

Linx is our effort to make a developer friendly framework, keeping it simple and easy.
