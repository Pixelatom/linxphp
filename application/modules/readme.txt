Place here your modules folders.

Modules are a simple way to group code into convenient "bundles". 
A Module can have it's own templates, configuration, routes, hooks, and more. 

A Module could be everything from a database ORM to a robust authentication system. 

In many ways you can actually think of the application folder as the special default Module.
