LinxPHP Core/system
===================

What is LinxPHP?
---------------

LinxPHP is an open source, object oriented MVC web framework built using PHP5 that aims to be swift, simple, and small.

LinxPHP is licensed under a [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), so you can legally use it for any kind of open source, commercial, or personal project.

Getting Started
---------------

### Class Names and File Location

Class names in LinxPHP follow a strict convention to facilitate autoloading.

The following conventions apply:

1. The PHP file name must be the same as the class name.
2. All class file names and directory names are lowercase.
3. All classes should be in the application/classes directory.

### Coding Standards

In order to produce highly consistent source code, we ask that everyone follow the coding standards as closely as possible.

#### Naming Conventions

##### Classes

We use CamelCase for classes:
	
	class AdminController extends Controller{ 

##### Functions and Methods

Functions should be all lowercase, and use under_scores to separate words:

	function drink_beverage($beverage)
	{

##### Variables
All variables should be lowercase and use under_score, not camelCase:

	// Correct:
	$foo = 'bar';
	$long_example = 'uses underscores';
	 
	// Incorrect:
	$weDontWantThis = 'understood?';
