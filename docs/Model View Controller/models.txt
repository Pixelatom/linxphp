Models
======

From Wikipedia:

> The model manages the behavior and data of the application domain, responds to requests for information about its state (usually from the view), and responds to instructions to change state (usually from the controller).

Linx includes a powerful Object Relational Mapping (ORM) module that allows for manipulation and control of data within a database as though it was a PHP object. Once you define the relationships ORM allows you to pull data from your database, manipulate the data in any way you like, and then save the result back to the database without the use of SQL. By creating relationships between models that follow convention over configuration, much of the repetition of writing queries to create, read, update, and delete information from the database can be reduced or entirely removed. All of the relationships can be handled automatically by the ORM library and you can access related data as standard object properties.

Creating your Model
-------------------

To create a model for the table members in your database, create the file application/models/member.php with the following syntax:

	class Member extends Model
	{
		...
	}
