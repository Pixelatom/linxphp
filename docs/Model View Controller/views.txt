Views
=====

Views are files that contain the display information for your application. This is most commonly HTML, CSS and Javascript but can be anything you require such as XML or JSON for AJAX output. The purpose of views is to keep this information separate from your application logic for easy reusability and cleaner code.

Views themselves can contain code used for displaying the data you pass into them. For example, looping through an array of product information and display each one on a new table row. Views are still PHP files so you can use any code you normally would. However, you should try to keep your views as "dumb" as possible and retreive all data you need in your controllers, then pass it to the view.

Creating View Files
-------------------
View files are stored in the templates directory of the application folder. You can also create sub-directories within the templates directory to organize your files. All of the following examples are reasonable view files:

application/templates/home.php
application/templates/pages/about.php
application/templates/products/details.php

Loading Templates
-----------------

Templates will typically be created inside a Controller using the Templates's constructor method.
