Designing Models
================
As mentioned previously, model properties can be configured using YAML in doc comments. This method allows you to set properties types, lenght and relationships between models.

Model Configuration
-------------------
Currently the only configuration supported at Model level is the table name:
	/**
	 * table: users
	 */
	class Member extends Model
	{
		...
	}

Properties Configuration
------------------------

### Setting id property
The following example shows how to create an numeric, auto-increment, single id property.
	
	/**
     * type: integer
     * primary_key: true
     * auto_increment: true
     */
    public $id;

The following example shows how to set multiple properties as id (composite idetifier).

	/**
     * type: integer
     * primary_key: true
     */
    public $property1;
	
	/**
     * type: string
     * primary_key: true
     */
    public $property2;


### Setting the type of the DB field
Currently 
	
### Setting the lenght of the DB field
Lenght of DB fields can be set the following way:

	/**
     * lenght: 32
     */
    public $password;
